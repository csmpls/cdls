The social fMRI: measuring, understanding, and designing social mechanisms in the real world

data-driven observation - but what about reflecting these observations back to the community?

how does doing so - the "social mirror" - affect behavior?

gets at this, but **did not dig into how system analyses were being interpreted, or to what extent they were being trusted**

extended Joan diMarco's work on conversation clocks - looking at behavior, yes, it balanced participation. 

> We're not arguing that balanced conversation is ideal. We're arguing that social mirrors such as the conversation clock have an intrinsic power to influence group behavior. Therefore, social mirrors should be carefully designed for specific situations. 

THE SOCIAL MIRROR IS A SOCIAL SIGNAL

cues are unconscious/unintended, signlas are intended. social mirrors *combine signals adn cues*.

group memory or archiving...

**Distorting Social Feedback in Visualizations of Conversation**
Bergstrom, System Science (HICCS) [def cite](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6148670&contentType=Conference+Publications)

what happens when we distort the conversation clock purposefully?

*participants will accept some significantly distorted visualizations as an accurate representation of conversation, however, distorted feedback provides only minimal impact on conversational balance. These findings suggest the mechanism in visualization that drives individuals towards balanced conversation is not solely influenced by the visual feedback and remains an open question for future work.*

(1) i can challenge the assumption that social mirrors are "unbiased" (like come on, they're *interfaces*); 

>  a speaker will perceive they are contributing more when their contribution is emphasized via distortion. [..] We conclude that the pressure a social mirror applies is not directly tied to the accuracy of the visualization it displays.

(2) i can explore whether distortion ever really works; do people ever trust sensors mroe than their intuition?; or is it simply the visualization that makes them act a certain way, not what the visualization displays?

(3) (burning question) **how do social mirrors affect not self-perception, but other-perception?**
