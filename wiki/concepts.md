academia strength is knowing what counterexamples are relevant and which aren't

[Tarleton Gillespie - politics of 'platforms'](http://nms.sagepub.com/content/12/3/347.abstract) - understanding of how term 'platforms' was used to political ends

[ronald kline - information technology as a keyword](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/technology_and_culture/v047/47.3kline.html) - analysis-free history of the term

[leo marx - the emergence of a hazardous concept](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/technology_and_culture/v051/51.3.marx.html) - 'technology' not popular term until 1900-1920. word came to fill ' a conceptual—void, which is to say, an awareness of certain novel developments in society and culture for which no adequate name had yet become available'. **throreau quote** == kevin kelly

>Martin Hilbert argues[..] to quantify the amount of information handled by society (Hilbert, 2012). [..] quantify *the amount of information you handle (i.e., create or store or consume etc.) in the course of one four-to-eight hour period,* whether at home, at school, or elsewhere. Remember to include not just the *types of sources discussed by Bohn & Short and Lyman & Varian, but also the “incidental” and ambient information that we encounter as we drive to work, eat breakfast, or call home*; [..] Assess the statistical feasibility and analytic insightfulness of the result: what questions does the exercise raise for a theory of “information” in the large?to the special section of IJOC [see "background reading," below].

[Roger Bohn & James Short - how much information?](http://hmi.ucsd.edu/pdf/HMI_2009_ConsumerReport_Dec9_2009.pdf) - measured by amount of data deliered to people .. well, how much of that are they actually processing? our cursory measurements indcate that the amount of information delivered by modern media formats might outstrip our cognitive processing abilities.....

[peter lyman, hal varian etc - how much information?](http://www2.sims.berkeley.edu/research/projects/how-much-info-2003/execsum.htm) - figure of 800MB per person per year made me lol .. saw figure of 1.8 million megabytes in mit tech review article 2013

[claude shannon - mathematical theory of communication (1948)](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=584093)

actual message is one message selected from a se of possible messages.

prediction: logarithms will appear and reappear

flip/flop circuts motivate bits

wanst obvious in 1948 that fig 1 would be so generalizeable.

discrete: finite symbols; 1.1 we see "bits per second"; 1.2 we start to motivate entropy by showing letters in english are not completely random (e.g. 'e' appears more freq than 'q', 'th' more freq than 'xp', etc). so we can model producers of discrete information (i.e. coders, language-users) as generators of stochastic processes, specifically markov models, specifically **"ergodic"** ones (i.e. statistical conditions are teh same in the generation of each sequence - we assume language is (basically) ergodic)

**1.3 - basically horse ebooks** - generating n-grams of english

versus continuous: e.g. ECG

II.XI - noise; signal does nota lways undergo same change in transmission ,, idea of error correction - related to [nyquist-shannon sampling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem) - 'The sampling theorem introduces the concept of a sample-rate that is sufficient for perfect fidelity for the class of bandlimited functions'

[fred dretske - the epistomology of belief](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00485371) - " example of "tricking" an altimeter by putting it in a barometric chamber, or "tricking" the frog by projecting dark spots on the wall. have we really tricked them? do they really have a concept of altitude, or flies, respectively? to have the concept of X, it is not enough to be able to classify Xs and non-Xs: 

> Unless the information that the X's are X is
made available to the learner (or instrument), and it is this information
that is used to discriminate and classify, the system will not be
representing anything as an X

and how concept of knowledge tells us somehing about the concept of information

> the epistemic character of the concept of information and
its connection with knowledge. [..] what concept a person acquires during learning, and hence
what beliefs he is henceforth capable of holding, is restricted to the
kind of information he is capable of picking up and processing. But, in
virtue of the connection between information and knowledge, we now
see that this is equivalent to saying that the beliefs a person is capable
of holding as a result of learning are restricted to the sorts of things
that that person (given his information processing resources) is
capable of knowing.  

> The argument is rather simple so let me recapitulate. To learn what
a dingbat is, and hence to acquire the conceptual resources necessary
for believing that something is a dingbat, one must not only be exposed
to dingbats, but to the information that they are dingbats. Not
only must this information be made available, it must be picked up and
used by the learner to guide his discriminatory and identificatory
responses if he is to be credited with the relevant concept. Since this is
so, the learner cannot come to believe something is a dingbat unless
he has the cognitive (i.e., information processing) resources for knowing
that something is a dingbat.

overal, **an individual can believe only what she has the resources for knowing**

[warren weaver - recent contributions to MTC 1948](http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i218/s15/Weaver_Recent-Contributions.pdf) - shannon's work relates back to boltzmann's observations on 'statistical physics'. communications can be split into 3 problem spaces: technical (accuracy of symbols), semantic (precision of meaning), and effectiveness (leads to desired conduct). makes the point that shannon's theory at the first level is also a theory of the other levels.

[norbert wiener - cybernetics (introduction)](http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b4424294;view=1up;seq=15) - 
originally interested in partial differential equations; pg 10 suggests a binary computer with a memory 
and a cache. he worked on aiming missles at moving targets. feedback is a crucial concept to him; this is missing in shannon's formulation.

[nunberg - farewell](http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~nunberg/farewell.pdf) - information in the "abstract" sense versus the kind you get at an information booth. there is a priviliged sense to information - i.e. a moulding of the mind - present 

"i wrote this book for my own information" john locke; information as in *shaping of the mind*
