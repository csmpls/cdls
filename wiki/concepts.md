flip/flop circuts motivate bits

wanst obvious in 1948 that fig 1 would be so generalizeable.

discrete: finite symbols; 1.1 we see "bits per second"; 1.2 we start to motivate entropy by showing letters in english are not completely random (e.g. 'e' appears more freq than 'q', 'th' more freq than 'xp', etc). so we can model producers of discrete information (i.e. coders, language-users) as generators of stochastic processes, specifically markov models, specifically **"ergodic"** ones (i.e. statistical conditions are teh same in the generation of each sequence - we assume language is (basically) ergodic)

[fred dretske - the epistomology of belief](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00485371) - " example of "tricking" an altimeter by putting it in a barometric chamber, or "tricking" the frog by projecting dark spots on the wall. have we really tricked them? do they really have a concept of altitude, or flies, respectively? to have the concept of X, it is not enough to be able to classify Xs and non-Xs: 

> Unless the information that the X's are X is
made available to the learner (or instrument), and it is this information
that is used to discriminate and classify, the system will not be
representing anything as an X

and how concept of knowledge tells us somehing about the concept of information

> the epistemic character of the concept of information and
its connection with knowledge. [..] what concept a person acquires during learning, and hence
what beliefs he is henceforth capable of holding, is restricted to the
kind of information he is capable of picking up and processing. But, in
virtue of the connection between information and knowledge, we now
see that this is equivalent to saying that the beliefs a person is capable
of holding as a result of learning are restricted to the sorts of things
that that person (given his information processing resources) is
capable of knowing.  

> The argument is rather simple so let me recapitulate. To learn what
a dingbat is, and hence to acquire the conceptual resources necessary
for believing that something is a dingbat, one must not only be exposed
to dingbats, but to the information that they are dingbats. Not
only must this information be made available, it must be picked up and
used by the learner to guide his discriminatory and identificatory
responses if he is to be credited with the relevant concept. Since this is
so, the learner cannot come to believe something is a dingbat unless
he has the cognitive (i.e., information processing) resources for knowing
that something is a dingbat.

overal, **an individual can believe only what she has the resources for knowing**

[warren weaver - recent contributions to MTC 1948](http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i218/s15/Weaver_Recent-Contributions.pdf) - shannon's work relates back to boltzmann's observations on 'statistical physics'. communications can be split into 3 problem spaces: technical (accuracy of symbols), semantic (precision of meaning), and effectiveness (leads to desired conduct). makes the point that shannon's theory at the first level is also a theory of the other levels.

### economistis on information
hayek says: society's problem is a "division of knowledge" (1937). search for information == ascertainment of market price (stigler's view). fama's view: prices "reflect" information (are not informaiton themselves).

[the university in the digital age - paul duguid](http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~duguid/SLOFI/U_in_Digital_Age.htm):

 > We, however, doubt that the university will dissolve into cyberspace so easily. The idea of the virtual university, we suspect, both underestimates how universities as institutions work and overestimates what communications technologies do. Learning, at all levels, relies ultimately on personal interactions and, in particular, on a range of implicit and peripheral forms of communication that technology is still very far from being able to handle proficiently
 
 the purchasing power needed to get a physical-campus degree rather than an online one will further stratify students
 
 > it may be wiser to consider ways to divide each student's career between time better spent on campus or in communities and time better spent on-line-so that all may have the opportunity to experience the best of both worlds. [..] ** it may be better to think of it "looking" in many ways surprisingly similar but "being" very different, because the most profound changes may be those made in the institutional arrangements rather than the physical infrastructure that makes up what people think of as a university.**
 
 > Our answers suggest that it is a mistake to think of the university "delivering" knowledge or students as "receiving" it. Central to higher education is the way universities provide access to communities of scholars and testimony for a student's experience among these communities.
 
 > though it can seem a crude measure, in fact the exchange value of a degree remains a fairly sensitive indicator of the market status of a university, a degree, a discipline, and a graduate. [..] But we also want to suggest that degrees are actually more complex. *They don't simply either helpfully represent or unhelpfully misrepresent what universities do. Rather, they provide a helpful misrepresentation*-a misrepresentation that provides both universities and society with important slack in a system that should not be too taut. **The degree's exchange value gives both universities and students a certain license to do what the degree permits but cannot acknowledge. It allows students to "play the game" in varieties of creative ways, on the simple condition that in they end they "win" a degree. Behind the "front" of the diploma, students and faculty can undertake activities that are socially valuable but not easily evaluated for the market. Simultaneously, it gives the job market and society as a whole more diverse and versatile candidates than they probably know to ask for.**
 
>  the core competency of universities is not transferring knowledge, but developing it, and that's done within intricate and robust networks and communities. 

"the rudiments of community joining" == "begun to learn how to learn". the true value of an undergraduate degree. this is perhaps the most important thing i'll learn today.

### Interfaces as drivers of human behavior: Senses of "information" in wearable computing

**notes** ask if "information" is internally consistent; contrast 2 papers that should be compatable, see that they are not talking about the same thing. **paper by klein in beginning - management science**. 

Wikipedia defines bioinformatics as “an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data.” One might assume that wearable computers outfitted with biological sensors are bioinformatic tools. However, Sandy Pentland (some journalists have labeled him the “godfather of wearables”), who approaches wearable computing from computer science rather than from medicine, makes no explicit reference to the field of bioinformatics in his work, even though his studies focus primarily on monitoring and analyzing biological data.

In this paper, I catagorize multiple senses of “information” as the word is used in Meeting Mediator (Kim, Chang, Holland & Pentland, 2008), a study in which physiological data are “mined” to provide feedback to participants in a meeting. I contrast these senses of “information” with those that arise in a bioinformatics methods paper with ostensibly similar themes, Data mining in bioinformatics. I offer the manipulation of human behavior as a theme to reconcile the senses presented by these two works, and gesture toward the role of the interface as an opinionated actor in the formation of insights from physiological data. I conclude with further questions and future work.
