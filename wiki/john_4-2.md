## my proposal

[[research agenda]] - a framework for dissertation proposal....

quote points to how difficult this problem is. behavior change comes not from data, not just from gf asking, but ashay checking him/herself. 3 steps removed from data itself

interesting but hard to establish causality

> What we share about our bodies, and with whom we share it, could have serious impacts on the way we are perceived by others, and on our own behavior.

keep it as you have it - but be mindful that this is an assertion. make this assertion *so that you can test it.* serious vs. non-serious, could be a question in and of itself

can you spin a story from the experiment to an example in real-world equivilent? the real-world interpersonal relationship. not one that exists today but one that is possible in the future. *to answer a skeptic on relevance* perfectly fine that it doesnt exist today, but make an argument that we can extrapolate. that we can peculate. *use the eeg breakup confession*. that this scenario is likely in the near future. in 2015 people imagine **apple watch**. 2 ppl in love can share heartbeats. if thats possible in 2015 you have some creative license. 2017-2018. when im graduating. then 2019/2020 when im giving job talks. what type of signals will we be able to collect? on what kind of platforms will we be choosing to share them? with what objectives?

**TODO construct a couple of these near future scenarios**. 3 scenarios ive just imagined, i see there's some pattern. bring this pattern back to experimental study. **motivate your choice of how you design experimental study**.

*i.e. why risk and uncertainty? why this game?*. this is to help design what that technology should look like

### question 1 

> what kind of meaning do people build around wearable sensor data (heartrate, EEG, etc), especially as it relates to mood or mental state?

why these? *explicitly not fitness - what motivates people to move, that field is different*

what is mood? vs emotion? e.g., emotion shorter duration, mood is days or weeks. *short-term changes, not like scientology e-meter. so, emotion, more than mood or temperment*

this falls in affective community? *instinct is no, something to chew on.*

**TODO** alternate interpretation, expansion of the scope. 21st century version of affective computing. or, is there some fundamental inconsistency? no no, they talk about this, i talk about this? a new field? *hmm...*

**TODO** find where rosalind picard has published the last 5 years

my wifes idea. affectiva. talk to CEO, she said dataset+sdk lets do research colabs. **automatically generate emoticons**? *yeah or overlay them on people's faces as they interact.* OR *involuntarily send emoticons thru textjQuery111008644416120110721_1428014163429? without sender seeing emoticon until after they send the text??*

clearly the answer is subjective. so survey is god

### question 3

when you say private communication? *as opposed to twitter, as opposed to on facebook, as opposed to with your insurance company*

the word "mediate". maybe we are having a conversation and i show you my data. perhaps when our communication is entirely via these signals. is one a special case of the other? or are they just so different we should consider them separately? *hmm..*


### methods

why k-12? ... ? BIOPAC doing this at college level. he has captive audience. 

thumbkiss. \*laughs\* very thought provoking. how do you design an experiment?

digital oxytocin. something that *creates trust and bonding?*

with noura:  co-present interactions; tools for intimacy misses this

sequencing -- 
    coye 
    thumbkiss
    thing with noura?
    k-12

how do you make the whole greater than the sum of parts? *hmm.. i need to do an exp first, at least one, but im confident i can do it, i just need to remember what the high-level question is*

each of these should answer parts of the high-level question

could be a back-and-forth type of refinement, too. top-down as well as bottom-up

## gesture recorder demo

[you are good at webapp stuff - leverage this in your research]

prepare for may 9 : opportunity to collect data -> opportunity to get MIDS to analyze data.

- scary -- **TODO find a stimulus**  
- funny superbowl ad  
- A/B test on the two projectors  
- mental tasks for passthoughts  

## collecting signals from the ear

me and john discovering best tasks + best electrode positions. use papers as a starting pointing

remember, temporal lobe; auditory tasks

- baseline; close your eyes+focus on your breathing  
- motor imagery; moving extremities   
- auditory; play sounds, attend to a particular tone/freq    
- imagined auditory; hear a tune in your head
- imagine a cube rotating in your head (clockwise/counter)
- think about whatever you want to think about; but something you can repeat

**TODO: add these tasks; make sure 1 reading is "right"; do 5 second recordings**
 
 ## indra
 
**todo**. indra: who is the target audience? *i think bioinformatics, i want to challenge conventional wisdom, these sensors are ba, eeg for instance not even measuring eeg alone*

yes but not people who would turn a deaf ear

how about:

- EMBC - engineering medical biological ..  ? place w eear eeg papers are published

- CSCW - very easily will say "yeah this i shwere CMC is going as a next step" **TODO** ask coye

- affective computing

- PhyCS

**TODO** identify conference dates, submission dates; make this your yearly calendar; things you read things you pay attention to.
