## 3EG: Ear EEG (EEEG)

### modular client

how can we make it less complected?

how can we separate pairing/maintaining connection

with whatever we do with the data?

**REMEMBER**:  when you get a `signal_quality` event, that refers to the reading BEFORE, not the reading after.

**REMEMBER**: must have an an `initialized` value that turns true when we're getting good readings (at beginning)

### application layer

pair,   
tell me when we're getting good readings

now i can start an n-frame recording whenevs

### user interface
when the device is paired, show a URL to go to (or just open browser)

enter id once + pick what position its in (chart provided)

now you can just pick an activity from a list + press 'record'
