## 3EG: Ear EEG (EEEG)

## touches up

script unresponsive on page

doesnt let you record until you pick some task

sketch out analysis pipeline -- cosine similarity

bring neuroskies

### global priorities

1. collect data on forehead + ear, individual-by-individual, look at classifiability of task-pairs

2. indra scraper + event

### modular client

for [[indra]] just need to figure out where the timing bit goes - but my instinct is that the flask server communicates with the world, and the ```mindwave_client``` just communicates with the flask server

**REMEMBER**:  when you get a `signal_quality` event, that refers to the reading BEFORE, not the reading after.

### user interface
when the device is paired, show a URL to go to (or just open browser)

enter id once + pick what position its in (chart provided)

now you can just pick an activity from a list + press 'record'
