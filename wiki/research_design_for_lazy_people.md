# Steve Weber's patented research design for lazy people

1. What's the question?
2. Where does it come from?
3. What's the answer? (Hypothesis)
4. How did I get there?
5. So what?

think: checklist

instead of falsifying the hypothesis, it could be more generative to think, "what if this is 5x or 10x more **true** than i think it is?"

not just what's the hypothesis, but **what's the answer to the question**. if you want to be lazy, you want those two wheels to fit tightly.
