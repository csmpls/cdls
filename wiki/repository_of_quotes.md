> Humans are incapable of securely storing high-quality cryptographic keys, and they have unacceptable speed and accuracy when performing cryptographic operations. (They are also large, expensive to maintain, difﬁcult to manage, and they pollute the environment. It is astonishing that these devices continue to be manufactured and deployed. But they are sufﬁciently pervasive that we must design our protocols around their limitations.)
