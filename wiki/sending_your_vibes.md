## idea
1. press button - seamlessly begins "correlative recording" with anyone who's also engaged at that time.
2. another way of thinking about it:  when i press a button, i get to see the data of anyone else (among my friends) who were also recording at that time

limitations for "at that time" (e.g. were they in the same room? general area? no?) can always be added later

for now, it just goes to a web interface with multi-viewpoint video / visualization

## research question:

1. do people feel creeped out?
2. how do the people feel who are being recorded?
3. what kinds of observations do people make?

## project description
Pressing a button on your temple shares your physiological states with another person, for a limited amount of time

## ui problem
a button
feedback to the user about engagement
feedback to the participants about with whom they are engaging

## evaluation
is it possible to accurately evaluate such a system in a way thats decoupled from HOW info are being analyzed exactly?
