## every day, in every way, i am getting better and better and better. 

right now i'm thinking about the [[placeish internet]], [[alternative internet technologies]] and [[attention-sensitive computing]]. 

my "making" interests lean toward [[wearables]] and [[software art]].

## otherwise

hobbyishly, i'm interested in [[environment design]], or the structure of things we inhabit; and [[object design]], or the structure of things we use.  

and the deepest rabbithole of them all is [[music]].

## i see a future in
i maintain a list of [[withering interests]].

an updated list of [[present predictions]] should be the innermost garden of my mind. when i'm older maybe. a [[repository of quotes]] is probably good intellectual practice.
