### quantified recess - victor lee

different strategies for boosting steps cores revealed different interpretations of how the data were calculated - experimenting w the subjectivity of measures. what was the feedback loop?

care about metrics enough to game them

basically a couple students learned lessons about removing outliers and how this affected means and medians

emily liked to read during recess -- shows how these measures are normative, encourage certain behaviors

dialogue btwn 2 kids and put it in your paper

### Integrating physical activity data technologies into elementary school classrooms - victor lee

good literature review

### Lessons learned from an initial effort to bring a Quantified Self “meetup” experience to a new demographic - victor lee

normative assumptions:
- appearances of device (wanting to stand out versus fit in)
- access to devices
- community expectations around ownership
- leisure time / control of schedule

> Quantified Self “meetup” groups appear to be appeal
largely to middle-aged white males. What happens
when the target demographic is changed to high
school-aged Latina girls?

appearances matter; not everyone has access to devices

> A second lesson we came to appreciate was that access
to necessary support technologies varied, but the
devices tend to make an implicit assumption that users
will have access to the latest and greatest devices. One
student, who was very interested in the wifi scale did
not actually have reliable wifi at home. She ended up
passing the scale on to another student in the
workshop who did have wifi and was interested in
looking at weight over time. What ended up happening
was that the scale became, initially unbeknownst to
her, a novelty in the home. Her family had never
owned a scale before, and having one provided, even
temporarily, through a university project, was very
appealing. It turned out that everyone in the family
used the scale, and some family members even
brought over friends and neighbors over to try out the
scale. This was determined from a large number of
measurements made across a broad range of weights.

### lee & dumont - An Exploration into How Physical Activity Data-Recording Devices Could be Used in Computer-Supported Data Investigations

still very much about data - especially ideas of centerness in distributions of data. 

im more interested in students understanding their own bodies. reflect upon their bodies    and emotions

realtime data could let them test hypotheses - what makes your heart go up? how quickly does your heart respond? how does your heart respond compared to your (more/less athletic) freind's?

### exhibiting data - leliah lyons

letting people dynamically filter data by time. a UI had a left-to-right timeline

compared either left-to-right physical/walking timeline, versus a more "embodied" one in which you move literally forward to go forward in time. and they found *people talked about the data in the 1st person more in the embodied condition.*

### forward ->

look into efforts to get kids to understand their own bodies through embodied activity. interesting literature to connect this to
