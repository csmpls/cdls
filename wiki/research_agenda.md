## How does physiological sensor data mediate interpersonal communication

> I have used sleep tracker for a while and noticed no discernible difference in my sleep habits. At some point, I mentioned this to my girlfriend who now occasionally asks me to show her my sleep cycle data when I complain about being tired or when I am grumpy. I think about this when I have to choose between watching that extra episode of House of Cards or sleeping and that has made a big difference in my sleeping habits. But, I don't know how I feel about sharing the same information with my insurance company.

What we share about our bodies, and with whom we share it, could have serious impacts on the way we are perceived by others, and on our own behavior.

Small, wearable sensors promise to yield a fundamentally new kind of data: non-medical data about the human body, as it exists in our natural habitat, outside of lab or medical environments. While these sensors have been used for mHealth or non-medical wellness (QS), it is not well understood how people interpret the data from these sensors. 

How do people relate bodily signals to mood, temperment, or state of mind? How can the transmission of these signals affect our perception of other people?

questions:

- How do people build meaning around the data they see from others, and how do software interfaces 

- How is people's behavior affected by the sensor data they see from other people?

- What motivates people to share their physiological data with other people?

- how does physiological sensor data mediate interpersonal communication? 

research projects:

- K-12 Heart Lab: Building and testing hypotheses with real-time heartrate data. 

- Interpreting heart-rate data in risky interactions

- Thumbkisses: Are kisses really in the thumb

- Sharing EEG data between students in a classroom

## before each study

1) What is the problem? What are you going to solve?

2) Who cares? Why should people care about this problem?

3) What have other people done about it? Literature review. Why is that not sufficient? What are the gaps and unanswered questions?

4) What are you going to do about it? Your approach

5) What are you really going to do about it? Methods, operationalization, sample

6) What do you expect to find? What did you find? Results

7) What does this mean? Conclusions

8) Who cares? Implications

9) Where are you going to publish? What are you going to do next?

10) What are you going to be doing in 5 years?
