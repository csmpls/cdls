### 2/10 benvolo - origins of modern town planning

ventilation dictated by position in construction block
utopian to "even" these asymmetries across developments
i'm reminded of [a danish savings bank] middlefart sparekasse, where they've made sure everyone has the SAME amount of view of the ocean 
is it possible to make things completely "even"?

p36 / 25a looks like that round kolegium in dk

46 robert owens  /  overstepping bousdn of data science .. and yeah basic tension is individual freedom/mechanistic process ...... still a tension, with surveillance, we need some surveillance to know when pipes break etc but how pervasive should our surveillance be? just infrastructure/local/tracking cellphones/CCTV etc - real tension still being explored

77 buonarotti french +1830, inspiration for cabet, cabet's *voyage in icarie*, proto-communist
awesome cult inspired by that -- similar story to lots of cults i'm thinking of Father Yod/The Source Family .......... 

**reductio ad absurdum** dissolution until it is basically "absorbed" into its environment as vegetarian-food-to-celebrities in LA or New Icaria becoming a park

### 2/10 baxter - paradox of a capitalist utopia

wait, "Perfect community not actually perfect, residents disappointed"  ?

1880 - pullman/ford influence -- isnt this just a normal sweatshop with a good 
is there a connection between a factory and the utopic visions? are existing co-operative factories [examples] utopic?

> 1) It alienated workingclass people from individuals and communities who shared their systems ofvalues and identity, (2) It geographically isolated people from broader commu-nity networks and other opportunities for employment (a noted failsafe incapitalism), (3) It offered a constant basis for comparison between their ownvalues and preferences and those of the upper and middle classes in a way thatconsistently suggested theirs were undesirable and inferior, and (4) It offeredworkers a way to envision themselves collectively against the dominant culturein and out of the workplac

### 2/10 C FOURIER - theory in social organization (1820)

> The real task of political economy is to seek an outlet from civilization, not to perfect it

..

> Liberty, unless enjoyed by all, is unreal and illusory. . .to secure liberty a Social Order is necessary which shall (1) Discover and organize a system of industry; (2) Guarantee to every individual the equivalent of their natural rights; and (3) Associate the interests of rich and poor. It is only on these conditions the masses can be secured a minimum of comfortable subsistence and enjoyment of all social pleasures. Man has seven natural rights: (1) Gathering of Natural Products; (2) Pasturage; (3) Fishing; (4) Hunting; (5) Interior Federation (association with others); (6) Freedom from care; **(7) External marauding (to pillage others)**.

satanism >> humanism / self-worship

> "When, as a consequence of human improvement", said I, "the globe shall arrive at its final perfection, the great ocean is to be converted into a particular kind of lemonade, such as was fashionable at Paris in Fourier's time. He calls it limonade a cedre. It is positively a fact! Just imagine the city docks filled, every day, with a flood tide of this delectable beverage!"

-- Nathanial Hawthrone, the blithedale romance


### observation

heterotopia is essentially a humanistic space that takes the concepts of "personal experiences" and "shared experiences" to their logical conclusion.   meaning-spaces with an arbitrary number of participants created and destroyed on the fly.

### 2/10 lallement - godin / successful fourierists

godin of reunion project in texas:

> We must have no illusions, my dear Cantagrel. The greater part of those phalansterians – those true believers, those men of faith – tow hom you refer as being of means (and only God is privy to their number!), engage in the supposed liberal professions. Phalansterian young men, or married men with capable wives and no young children, laboring laborers and carpenting carpenters, and all in possession of the necessary resources, are alas an ideal, a theory,when it is a reality that we must face!”

godin had some understanding of human psyche!

is "industrial democracy" another word for co-op, co-operative?

> “True democracy, organized democracy,signifies the hierarchy of merit, knowledge, capability, establishedin every function without privileges and without erring, for thegreatest good of all. Any other way means anarchy, confusion anddisorder in the social elements. I am not that sort of democrat”

-Godin, 1881

> Godin finally took over his company’s destiny alone. In 1880, he founded the Association of capital and labor. By transforming the Company’s legal definition,his aim was to progressively hand the social capital over to all his personnel, who would progressively access ownership thanks to deeds. The concept was more Fourieristic than ever

> [...]

> Competition in school involved girls and boys equally; it was permanent, and its effects clear for all to see. After each recreation,as soon as the bell rang, the pupils got in line in order of merit in the subject their class had been assigned as homework for the week: reading, writing, spelling, analysis, style, arithmetic, history,drawing, crafts. The best pupils carried colored flags on which the type of composition they had produced was written in block letters.Ode to labor, emulation and merit, the parades were public. To stimulate and coax the pupils into action, decorations, badges in the shape of starry crosses, were also given to the most talented.Each month, they were awarded in solemn ceremony in the large central courtyard of the Palace. The Director of studies pinned thed ecorations on the deserving young chests herself.

> to the persons of the Familistere, particularlynewcomers, that it is contrary to Familistere practice to let thechildren go out barefoot, much less undressed; it is thereforecompulsory that they conform to our habits of decency and clean-liness if they want to remain in the Familistere.”
