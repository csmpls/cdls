## overall direction

there is no difference between sensors on our body or in our environment. collecting sensors around physical people is a human organization scheme that pigeonholes us into certain types of interpretations.  

first, we should be able to work with any sensor producing any stream of data. we don't care what data the sensors are producing, we just assume that there are *some* statistical regularities/trends in those data over time 

second, we should be able to configure these sensors in such a way that they can be transferred between people, or between people and the environment, fluidly, while continuing to make observations

now we are just **data in space.** streams of data attached to points in space. now things are interesting.

## Big Q's

1. When dealing with streaming information from biosensors, not every point of data matters. We're much more interested in an overall *model* of the data. **To what extent is it possible to replace a database with a model**?
