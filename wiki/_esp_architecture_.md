sensors should be able to move fluidly between wearability on humans/passive sensing in the environment

wearable devices will create a personal cloud/personal mesh, which will offer a value separate from what wearables folk are thinking about today

physiological signals will provide an added value, but their fulll potential will be unlocked when they can be related to stimuli int he environment, or contextualized along with the physiologcal responses of other, socially relevant persons

## questions

1. When dealing with streaming information from biosensors, not every point of data matters. We're much more interested in an overall *model* of the data. **To what extent is it possible to replace a database with a model**?

2. What are the possibilities for decentralizing the collection of data? Say I want to give you my data, but just you and not some intermediate party - what might this architecture look like?
