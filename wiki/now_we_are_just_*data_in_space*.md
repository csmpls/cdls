there is no difference between sensors on our body + sensors in our environment. organizing sensors around people is a human organization scheme that pigeonholes us into certain types of interpretations.

1. we should be able to work with any sensor producing any stream of data. we don't care what data the sensors are producing, we just assume that there are some statistical regularities/trends in those data over time

2. we should be able to configure these sensors in such a way that they can be transferred between people, or between people and the environment, fluidly, while continuing to make observations

now we are just data in space. streams of data attached to points in space. now things are interesting.
