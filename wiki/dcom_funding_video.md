hey! my name's nick merrill and i'm a phd student at UC Berkeley.

i made an ephemeral chat application 
in my free time over the past year


the way it works is,

you make up a name for a chatroom,
make up a pseudonym to use for the chat,
and send the URL of the chatroom to your friends.

they get the URL, and enter the chatroom.

thats it!
it's super simple, but it lets you post gifs, and it works right in your web browser

[cut back to me]

what really matters about don't creep on me! is a simple promise i make to the users: I don't track you. I don't log your IP address, and I don't store any messages on my servers. 

[animated model of some sort here]

When you send a message, I deliever it to the people who are in the same chatroom as you at the same time, then I delete it forever.

I don't log IP addresses, but if you want total anonymity, you can connect to DCOM through Tor, too.


"why do you trust us? well, you don't - the data stays encrypted from the moment the data is sent to the moment the data is delivered the recipient. and if you don't believe us, you can read the source code."

ince open source code is a prerequisite for determining the security of any piece of software, all code associated with dontcreeponme will be available on our github page, along with instructions for how to run your own version of dcom on your own servers.

I want to run DCOM as a service, not as a startup. I'm a grad student, and I rely on donations from users to run this server.

## what I will do with your money

I'm going to run DCOM on a nice server cluster, distributed over a few physical machines, in a data center. This should prepare us for some real use, and will help give us some buffer in the case of a denial-of-service attack. (note for written statement: 'It's been crazy lately', or st to that effect). 

Deploy an iPhone app.

Encrypt DCOM from end-to-end.  You can learn more about our encryption efforts, or join in, on our wiki.
