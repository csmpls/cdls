2. Try to figure out why they made the design choices they did; this is the most illuminating question to ask yourself. 

3. Study your predecessors' styles closely. This is best done by trying to sketch something in their several styles.

4. Keep a "sketch book" in which you put ideas, designs, and pieces of designs, whatever your medium. 

5. When starting a design, write down your assumptions about the users and the uses

6. Design, design, design!
