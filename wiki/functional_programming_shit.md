learn about programming web apps 

	- do the cljs tutorial
		*what is a complex key?
		*why find (i.e. return a key-value pair) versus simply (:key map)?
		*tho lists/etc are immutable, when you (def newlist (conj lista :thing), for example, (identical (rest newlist) lista). they are represented by the same thing in memory.
		*only “nil” and “false” are falsy — now what does this handwavy statement mean? “`undefined` is not *really* a valid clojurescript value and is *generally* coerced to `nil` “ ?
		* new things to me: **arity** (# of arguments); ["rest arguments"](http://ariya.ofilabs.com/2013/03/es6-and-rest-parameter.html)
		* all def[n] expressions are always top-level scope. even in closures
		* im gathering that ! (as in `set!`) means something is being mutated

	- try an om tutorial! *done, my refection:*
		* when it came to clearing a textbox after pressing submit, stuff got confusing and the code looked very long in the worked example.
		* multimethods seem potentially powerful, but i'm not sure whats wrong with if statements
		* i really find parenthesis matching quite annoying, even with the color coding thing. maybe i would get used to it.
		* i fear that clojure-land would "silo" me ...
		* **overall, it is still early in this game and the dominant technology has yet to appear. its more important to expand your understanding of programming, programming languages, and what makes webapps simple and good.**
