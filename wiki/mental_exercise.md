i close my eyes and imagine an abstract space. elements in the space represent aspects of my mental life. how they're arranged just comes to me. this part isn't important right now.

1. eyes closed.
2. let the scene come to you. don't force it. if it's the same as the day before, that's fine. if it's mostly empty, that's fine.
3. identify what the objects in the scene represent. unpack their forms and relative placements. 
4. just watch the scene and notice any changes.
5. relax, let go. focus on the point of your breath. not the thoughts but the blue sky.
