DCOM is [end-to-end encrypted], but if you're worried that someone is posing as your friend, you can use a key for added security.   

By deciding on a key in person with your friends, you feel safer in knowing ithat the pseduonyms in the room belong to the people you think. 

All users need to know the key before they enter the room, or they will not be able to decrypt any messages.

## about page

### a chat app that doesnt track you in any way

When you send a message, it goes to the people who are in the same room with you at the same time. Messages disappear from our servers immediately after the message is sent.

### no accounts - just enter a room and send a link to it

We never ask you for personal information and we never log your IP address. Read a [primer on using DCOM safely]().

### encrypted from end-to-end

Your data is encrypted from the moment you send your message to the moment its received by your friends. We [don't store your keys]() and we [don't trust SSL]().


[picture of myself]

i am a phd student at uc berkeley and not some tech idiot who's interests are "beer and coffee." i provide a simple service and provide [mathematical guarantees]() about its privacy. i also provide [guides]() that instruct you how to run this service on your own server. 

dontcreeponme is a [nonprofit, not a startup](), and relies on [people like you]().
