using existing telecommunications infrastructure to build a less centralized internet.

we can imagine a few reasons why undoing centrality is appealing

there is a world of commentary on the cypherpunks mailing list. i'm aware of [this excellent list of projects](https://github.com/redecentralize/alternative-internet), which is what got me into this mess in the first place. 

## designs that compel me.

0. **separating the bank from the factory in cloud computing applications**. right now, give someone your email address, you know where your data is stored AND where it's processed. how often do you give someone your bank acct number when you need to make a purchase?   .... llike google is great at apps but there can be PLENTY of other services to work as the "data bank" while preserving everything that's good about cloud computing.

1. immediately, **the tumblr of decentralized content** [mediagoblin](http://mediagoblin.org/pages/tour.html) seems closest to what i'm imagining, but [idas-blue](http://github.com/csmpls/idas-blue) is my baby and i'd like to talk about it approaching some aspect of this problem space.

2. a private, perhaps [[placeish|placeish computing]] network. one an alternative way to think about a social network is as a private internet shared between friends. (perhaps tribally).

3. alternative uses for mesh networking.  shared data processing,  local onion routing.

i'm not sure how [telehash](http://telehash.org/) fits into this but it clearly does. not sure why i would use [ArkOS](https://arkos.io) vs my existing webserver. not sure about [drogulus](https://github.com/ntoll/drogulus) vs [namecoin](github.com/namecoin/namecoin).
