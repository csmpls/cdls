### todo:

- switch theme to [cosmo](http://bootswatch.com/cosmo/#)
- write a script that proves database stuff works 
- make a view for each model (read: import front-end player, misc other crap)

### work queue:

- as a general rule, think, what if each model had a 1:1 mapping to views?
- users can have Favorites
- songs have an order in each collection
