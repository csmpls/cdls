### todo:

- write the tests and the models side-by-side
- only afterward, refactor the server code


### work queue:

- users can have Favorites
- songs have an order in each collection

## then....

- start an __init__ thats real modular
- adapt ``tests.py`` for each function in the 'flow'
- now you can work on a frontend again~
