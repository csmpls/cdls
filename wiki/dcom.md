## before funding

- sockets 1.x

- CLI client

- redis? (fork from master)

- dcom has its own github

## improvements
- when you close your laptop and reopen, not clear if it's conected or waht

- it should pop up with a warning when you're not connected.

- it auto-should reconnect after minor blips

- large gifs should not load

- images should be served https

## more minor

- should do st when javascript needs to be enabled

- dcom take donations: paypal, flattr, btcâ€¦.1/4 reqs ?

- multiline copy/paste

- when scrolled up, number missed should appear in title   (lil big details)


## seems necessary
- mute sound checkbox
- a "learn more" thing w/r/t the key (or remove key for now)
- adding "(using key)" to usernames is a huge hack and should be replaced with something in the protocol
