## organization

open-source-company-nonprofit.

1. look into 290M readings, see if theres anything in there about this.

2. make a wiki, or an issue ticket thread, somewhere where **people can participate**

3. figure out how profits are split,,,,,,,,,

alternatively/along with, see [[forming a nonprofit]]

## $$$

- [[dcom funding video]] 

---

## improvements
- when you close your laptop and reopen, not clear if it's conected or waht

- it should pop up with a warning when you're not connected.

- it auto-should reconnect after minor blips

- large gifs should not load

- images should be served https

## more minor

- should do st when javascript needs to be enabled

- dcom take donations: paypal, flattr, btcâ€¦.1/4 reqs ?

----

## work queue
- allow multiline copy paste
- when scrolled up, number missed should appear in title   (lil big details)

## seems necessary
- mute sound checkbox
- a "learn more" thing w/r/t the key (or remove key for now)
- adding "(using key)" to usernames is a huge hack and should be replaced with something in the protocol

--- 
## longer-term feedback 

## $$$

"the css is my own, the design is my own, the protocol is for the people"

## reported bugs/feedback
- what if the gradient was more gradual? like we are already in a relatively dark part of the gradient, and our convo hasn't been very long yet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"if we were to have like a really long two hour convo right now
oh boy
i wonder if the gradient is like a limiting factor on the length of conversations in this space
i'm curious how the gradient affects the psychological space of the conversation"

- message box should get taller when u type too much
- background flickers
- input box should scroll when you scroll

### seemingly fixed, but watch out for....
- users show up in rooms they aren't in :(
- server crashes when you close browser window after connecting to, but not entering, a room

## notes
- there should be a UI feature that shows you whether youre on WSS?
- copy/paste doesnt work in at least chrome.....pros/cons?
- tooltip explaining passwords + a link-to page to Learn more
- youtube & other video embeds?

## spitballing

ffff	but why, when there are things like chatsecure out there?  
ben	simplicity, and the feeling of disposability  
ben	the dcom experience is so smooth, with instant chatroom generation  
you can jump into a secure GROUP chat super easily  
ben	that is a big dela  
ben	I think that is actually what you accomplished best  
ben	quick, easy, no account   
just go in, go to a URL, set a password, and boom  
ben	privacy  


could charge for the app that uses might root server

and then also offer devs the chance to use their own app, but force them to host rooms made there?

big major thought for mobile: push notifications on room/enter/exit

possibility of implementing [deffie-helman key exchange by default](http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/1150/encrypting-and-obscuring-data-between-site-user-without-ssl)
