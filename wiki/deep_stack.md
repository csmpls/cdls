chanel, pelli, raveja, kuikkaniemi - Social interactions using mobiel phones and biofeedback -- Biofeedback in a social context -> motivate users to construct their own interpretations of teh signals

**but what sort of interpretations are they going to construct?** this is a fundamental question

true that interpreted signals are easier to discount

---



**do we trust sensors more than we trust our intuitions?** probably depends on what the sensors are saying.



a wristband that buzzes when the user feels ... 


intuition: people are more likely to be suspicious of a fancy algorithm (one that tells you "you dont like that person") then of a seemingly low-level one, like heartrate, where they construct their own meaning

> easy: have them do physical activities (run on a treadmill) and then evaluate how hard they think they worked out

what we're probing: **how does the "interpretation level" of a signal affect the amount of trust people have in it?** or, **what kind of signals are people likely to trust more than their intuitions?**

think youve scored a touchdown [touchdown sign]

identifying this is great ..  recongizing that is a challenging problem .. recongizing making some progress toward .. 

treadmill exp? john will buy a treadmill. ask EMG guy for coffee...he runs treadmill exps...ask him

what does your heartrate mean? look into that study..

look backward: some theory...from cog sci .... about human beings relate to (1) **quantitative signals**..... (2) **about themselves?** psych/cogsci expts with quantitative data abt the subjects seeing how it affects judgement

look forward:  crazy tech of the future, affectiva e.g., how much will individuals trust these conclusions?

central question good, consider different ways to try to attack it, operationalize it, etc, compelling to people from different fields

two things:

1. see if you can do a literature survey of *studies (psych->) how do signals (biosignlas without the bio) affect behavior*? even more interesting, *what kinds of representations to people build around quantitative signals?*  learn about their methods + experimental design. *social mirrors*. **recommend john 3 papers**

2. write a project proposal...one with the treadmill....2 more variations....Im going to submit a funding proposal, i've already articulated high-level research question. **bulletpoints is fine.** to help you organize, to force you articulate the essential components. plus potential pitfalls.

"a non-medical understanding of our bodies... our bodies outside of labs, non-medicalized/non-health understanding"  think about the center for long-term cybersecurity proposals.
