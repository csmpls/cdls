## active prototyping stuff
- what can you log?
- how can you stream/log data continuosuly?????

## learning about EDA/other sensing generally
- this [actual research talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSasaqQV2xg): "physiological phenotypes"...............but what actually *happens* when you share these data?
- this [ted talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujxriwApPP4): assymmetries can show emotional disbalance, seizures.. bullying showed a high peak, and a girl was able to make sense of that later using a long-term graph with her mom

## bitalino
- figure out how to "stream" data from the EDA
- hook up st with flask so you can viz it in d3
- sense EDA while doing hard math problems

## alternate thread
 - investigate [this device](http://neulog.com/)
