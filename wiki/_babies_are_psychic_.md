## newest idea

a social network based around communities rather than friends.

main page is

[ post entry box]

[ post - PIN FLAG]

flag: [spam / abusive / poor taste]
you can **anonymously** flag this post.

once a message is flagged, even once, it can be deleted by another member.

[invite people]
popup with the url and a reminder of the password (not cleartext unless you click some button)

## user flow

hi/ explain/ signuplogin

GO TO A ROOM:

rooms you've posted in

popular private rooms

NEW ROOM:

This room hasnt been created yet. 
[ Create Room ]

Protect with a password?

USER PAGE:
Picture
Bio

## need statement

if i want to get off facebook, i need the contact info of everyone i want to keep in touch with. the other options is a space or a forum for Cool Discourse............

(1) emails, and a public/userfriendly list of members for Staying In Touch  (off the grid). no messages stored on our servers 

(2) something fundamentally new in design.  iterating on: (facebook groups, hackernews/reddit r the main ones)


## running thesis

there is room for something in between facebook and reddit. ello is close, but the real answer is closer to hackernews.

possible jumping off points: https://github.com/danjac/newsmeme  (tho potentially better to just write it from scratch)

## design qs

whats differenceÂ btwn social network and forums?  

- **content based around individuals rather than conversations**   

- ability to interact with content nonverbally (likes)

why does hacker news work, and why/why not mgiht it work for babiesarepsychic?

how might a community like hackernews be modified to support interactions like those on facebook?

- real name (or at least firstname/lastname) is interesting to play with

- one account per email address/my moderation seems necessary for community experiments

## babies are psychic: who, why and how many: a manifesot

im a hosting party (literally hosting on servers, i.e. physical property that i own). you can invite whomever and you dont have to ask me. but, as in a real party, invite people you think will enjoy the party and whom the party will enjoy. 

- there could be an anonymous system by which people can be voted out lol how might that work? is there research on this? im thining: a button next to everyone that says "Remove." a ? next to it reveals: if this is your account, this will send you an email, and a link in that email will remove you from the listserv. if this is NOT your account, this user will get a "remove" email (all anonymous of course) and a # will appear next to their name indiciating how many times this month someone clicked Remove on them.

- start simple: a page with password shows current members -- you can register from there

- start simpler: just a mailing list: why not?
